# Introduction
Pattern recognition for humans can be termed as a constant attempt to identify environment information that matches internal information. This project is based on predicting whether or not a potential bank customer will actually sign up for a long term deposit with the bank or not based on the [UCI Bank marketing dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing). This computation is based on parameters like education, marital status, age, etc. The data provided here is highly imbalanced and I've applied several data pre-processing techniques to overcome the issue, providing a good accuracy and decent area under ROC curve.
